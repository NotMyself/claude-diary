id = admin-zc1.1 expand up depth 2
```

Press `Esc` to exit search mode.

**Note**: `/` is for searching **within a column** (filtering), while `Ctrl+Space` opens full **search mode** for BQL queries.

## Available Views

You currently have **7 views** configured:

### 1. **Default** (Start here!)

Standard kanban showing all work:
- Blocked
- Ready (issues you can work on now)
- In Progress
- Closed (Recent)

### 2. **Migration Epics**

Shows migration validation run epics:
- Active Epics
- Blocked Epics
- Completed Epics

### 3. **All Tasks**

Task-type issues only (filters out epics):
- Blocked
- Ready
- In Progress
- Done (Recent)

### 4. **By Priority**

All issues organized by priority:
- Critical (P0) - Non-equivalent logic
- High (P1) - Missing types, critical issues
- Medium (P2) - Test quality, normal work
- Low (P3-P4) - Warnings, nice-to-haves

### 5. **By Type**

All issues organized by type:
- Bugs
- Tasks
- Features
- Epics

### 6. **Planning Features**

Planning workflow features with task → bugfix hierarchy:
- Tasks Ready (ready to implement)
- Tasks In Progress (being worked on)
- Tasks with Bugfixes (quality review found issues)
- Tasks Done (completed features)

**Note**: Bugfix issues are **children of feature tasks**, not siblings. Use `Enter` on a task to see its bugfixes in tree view.

### 7. **Migration Validation**

Migration validator findings by severity:
- Non-Equivalent Logic (P0) - **Fix these first!**
- Missing Types (P1)
- Test Quality (P2)
- Warnings (P3-P4)
- Resolved

---

## Current Issues in Your Database

You have **339 total issues**:
- **26 open** (22 ready to work)
- **4 blocked**
- **313 closed**

Most issues are from **migration-validator** with labels:
- `migration-validation`
- `equivalence` (logic differences)
- `type-mapping` (missing types)
- `test-quality` (test coverage issues)
- Project labels: `tailorwell-security`, `tailorwell-accounting`, `tailorwell-caching`

---

## Recommended Workflow

### 1. Start with "Migration Validation" View

```bash
perles
# Press 'Ctrl+J' to cycle through views
# Keep pressing until you see "Migration Validation"
```

This shows your migration issues by severity. Start with the **P0 column** (Non-Equivalent Logic).

### 2. Press Enter on an Issue

See details:
- Description of what's different
- Project name
- Finding type
- Priority

### 3. Use Search Mode to Filter

Press `/` and try:

```bql
# Show P0 issues for TailorWell.Security
priority = 0 and label ~ tailorwell-security

# Show all equivalence issues (logic differences)
label ~ equivalence and status != closed

# Show test quality issues
label ~ test-quality
```

### 4. Switch to "By Priority" View

Press `v`, select "By Priority"

Focus on the **Critical (P0)** column first - these are non-equivalent logic issues that need immediate attention.

---

## Troubleshooting

### "No issues showing in columns"

This happens when the BQL query doesn't match your data. Try:

1. Press `v` to switch views
2. Try the **Default** view first (should show all issues)
3. If still empty, press `/` and search: `status != closed`

### "Keybindings not working"

- View switching: Use `v` (view picker) or `Tab` (cycle)
- Search: Use `/` (not `Ctrl+Space`)
- Help: Press `?` to see all keybindings
- Quit: `Ctrl+C` or `q`

### "Can't see recent activity"

Auto-refresh is enabled, but if needed:
- Press `Ctrl+R` to manually refresh
- Or restart perles

---

## BQL Query Examples

Press `Ctrl+Space` in perles to enter search mode:

### Finding Issues

```bql
# All P0 issues (critical)
priority = 0

# All bugs
type = bug

# Issues from last week
created > -7d

# Issues updated recently
updated > -3d
```

### By Project

```bql
# TailorWell.Security issues
label ~ tailorwell-security

# TailorWell.Accounting issues
label ~ tailorwell-accounting

# TailorWell.Caching issues
label ~ tailorwell-caching
```

### By Finding Type

```bql
# Non-equivalent logic (critical!)
label ~ equivalence

# Missing types
label ~ type-mapping

# Test quality issues
label ~ test-quality
```

### Dependencies

```bql
# Show issue with what blocks it
id = admin-zc1.1 expand up depth 1

# Show issue with what it blocks
id = admin-zc1.1 expand down depth 1

# Show full dependency tree
id = admin-cpn expand up depth *
```

### Combining Queries

```bql
# P0 TailorWell.Security issues
priority = 0 and label ~ tailorwell-security

# Open bugs with high priority
type = bug and priority <= 1 and status != closed

# Recent migration findings
label ~ migration-validation and created > -7d
```

## Next Steps

1. **Open perles now**: `perles`
2. **Switch views**: Press `Ctrl+V` for view menu, or `Ctrl+J` to cycle to "Migration Validation"
3. **Check "Migration Validation"**: See your P0 issues
4. **Try search mode**: Press `Ctrl+Space` and query: `priority = 0`
5. **View issue details**: Navigate to an issue, press `Enter`

## Tips

- **Start with "Migration Validation" or "By Priority" views** - These show the most important work
- **Use search mode liberally** - Press `/` to filter on the fly
- **Check dependency trees** - Press `d` on blocked issues to see what's blocking them
- **Multiple terminals** - Run `perles` in multiple terminals with different views open
- **Auto-refresh is on** - Boards update automatically when beads changes
